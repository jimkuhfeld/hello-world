I would like to say hello to all creatures in the known universe.
Hello, I come in peace.
Unless I'm hungry, then I might kill something.
Or if something encroaches on my territory, I've been known to reach with violent intent.
I do kill plants and eat them, but that seems less extreme, than killing other things.
With those exceptions, I come in peace.

I might destroy habitat, and create a dwelling.
Some creatures might consider that threatening.

I tend to pile up refuse from my use of natural resources, and transport it away from my lovely dwelling so I don't have to look at it.
Creatures that inhabit the area where I leave my "garbage", might consider that a hostile act.

I have no empathy for inanimate objects.
