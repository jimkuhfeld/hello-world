Given the way I'm carrying on regarding saying hello to the whole universe, I fear some of the local inhabitants may soon urge me to say goodby.
Goodbye. I didn't mean to make such a mess of it, but now I'll be going.
If convenient, however, I'd like to stay through month-end, since I paid in advance, and have theatre tickets for next Thursday.

THE END
